## Overview
This project is a machine learning model that classifies images of cats into different breeds. The model is built using PyTorch and trained on a dataset comprising various common cat breeds.

## Project Structure
Each subfolder in the `cat_v1` directory contains images corresponding to a specific cat breed of the following

- Bengal
- Domestic Shorthair
- Maine Coon
- Ragdoll
- Siamese

## Code
The code with good analysis is in the file `final.ipynb`

## the results

the weights of the neural network is saved in the file `cats_net.pth`
